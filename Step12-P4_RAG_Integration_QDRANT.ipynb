    "## Notebook Summary: Uploading 3GPP Chunks to Qdrant for Vector Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a Qdrant-based document storage pipeline for telecom-specific RAG applications. It prepares 3GPP chunks for retrieval by embedding and uploading them to a persistent vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Preprocessed Chunks**  \n",
    "   Loads up to 5,000 pre-chunked 3GPP segments from a `.pkl` file for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding**  \n",
    "   Generates normalized dense vectors using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Metadata Tagging**  \n",
    "   Each chunk is tagged with metadata such as source file path, release version (Rel-15 or Rel-16), and inferred section.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Qdrant Upload**  \n",
    "   Initializes a fresh Qdrant collection and uploads vector+metadata in batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Retrieval API**  \n",
    "   Defines a retrieval function that returns the top-k most similar chunks for a given telecom query using Qdrant's cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook enables fast, persistent, and metadata-aware retrieval of telecom contentâ€”serving as a backend foundation for future RAG pipelines, especially in distributed or cloud-based deployments."
