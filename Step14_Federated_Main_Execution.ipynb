    "# Notebook Summary — Federated LoRA + Central RAG Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook sets up a federated fine-tuning experiment for a telecom QA model (LLaMA-2 + LoRA) and evaluates pre-federation vs post-federation adapters with and without central RAG. It includes environment setup, data preparation for two clients, Flower-based FL simulation, adapter materialization, and a standardized evaluation harness.\n",

    "What this notebook does\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment & Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets cache dirs, CUDA settings, and verifies key packages/versions and GPU availability.\n",

    "Defines all project paths: base backbone, pre-FL adapters, output dirs, FAISS index & chunk store, client datasets, and results files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sanity Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensures required directories/files exist (base model, FAISS index, RAG chunks, checkpoints, results folders).\n",
